# How-It-Works
Insurance.Blockchain stores your Personal Private Information in an *Encrypted Vault*. You update it through your Uni.Key Wallet! Then insurance.blockchain runs a daemon process that periodically (monthly, weekly, etc.) submits your information, property, and type of insurance you want to various providers, getting updated quotes! Notifying you by email & text message if it finds a cheaper option beyond a threshold you set.

It also makes Switchikng insurance providers easier! With an A.I. agent handling all aspects of the transaction & timing.
